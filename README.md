# EDOPro HD Downloader

Based on [AlexanderRST's Cards Downloader](https://github.com/AlexsanderRST/edopro-hd-cards-downloader)

This programs downloads HD card images from [YGOPRODECK](https://www.ygoprodeck.com) database to replace the low resolution version which EDOPro downloads by default.

# Installation

## Windows

Download the [latest Windows release](https://github.com/NiiMiyo/EDOPro-Hd-Downloader/releases/latest) and unzip it at your EDOPro folder (Default should be something like `C:/ProjectIgnis/`).

## Non-Windows

Since I can't test non-windows compilations you will need to download the source code and compile it yourself. Then put the compiled file at your EDOPro folder.


# Usage

If you run the program and read the instructions you should be fine.

But for short:

- Insert the name of your deck (without the `.ydk` extension) when asked to download all the images of the cards in it.

- Insert `/allcards` to download images for all cards. Will probably take a while.

- Insert `/allfields` to download artwork of all Field Spell Cards.

- Insert `/help` if you want to know anything else.
